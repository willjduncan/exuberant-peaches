## Description

I designed this portfolio to show off my best coding projects, resume, and abilities so that potential employers can easily and enjoyably access them. The website itself will be another way to show off my coding skills, particularly with React.js.

I began with the framework, deciding to meld the file layout shown in Module 20 with they layout of activity 4 of Module 20's in-class assignments. After some trial and error, the components were set up in a way that satisfied me and I moved on to the styling. I decided to try and avoid using bootstrap in order to lower the amount of dependencies and keep reaction time quick. I styled component by component, beginning with the header and footer before moving on to the About page, Resume page, Contact page, and then Portfolio page before going back and completing the media queries.

## Credits

 The license was picked from [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).The WHEN/THEN section of this README was based off the project assignment Acceptance Criteria. Most influence was taken from Oh Snap of Module 20 and activity 4 of Module 20's in-class assignments. Many features were also translated from my original Professional Portfolio of Challenge 2. Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs, W3, and Google were critical to our success. The icons in the footer and for the tab were taken from flaticon: [https://www.flaticon.com/](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/book). They were designed by Roundicons Premium, Pixel Buddha and Freepik. Images were for Budget Tracker were taken from Pixabay. 



## Contributing

If you make changes, test it locally on a branch before pushing to main. Clone from the github site and make sure to create your own .env file with your own credentials.



## Tests

No tests written were made for this project, but Chrome DevTools is a critical tool in letting you test the program's ability to run in different environments to test its offline capabilities.
